I am writing the solution in just node. That is right. With no frameworks like express. Becuase for this project that might not be necessary.


A simple test ui is laid out in the home page.

this will make requests to the api.

do ```node server.js``` to run the server

the api endpoint matches that in the documentation

/api/visitors?date=YOUR-DATE-IN-MILLIS&ignore=THE-MUSEUM-TO-BE-IGNORED
